International Space Station Tracker using a QT Py board, GPS and OLED

This project uses a QT Py board from Adafruit, A battery backpack board from Oak Dev Tech, A BN-280 GPS board and a 128x128 pixel SSD1327 OLED screen and a 1000mAh Li-Ion battery.

The QT Py checks your current location then calculates  the location of the International Space Station (ISS) using a recent Two Line Element.
The ISS location is shown on a World map along with the location for the previous and next 50 minutes.
